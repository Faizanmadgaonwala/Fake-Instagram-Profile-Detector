In this hands-on project, we will build and train a simple artificial neural network model to detect spam/fake Instagram accounts. Fake and spam accounts are a major problem on social media. Many people on social media use fake Instagram accounts to create the illusion of having a large social media following. Fake accounts can be used to impersonate other people, as well as to sell fraudulent services/products. The data was taken from the Kaggle website. In this hands-on project, we will complete the following steps:

Importing datasets and libraries
We carry out exploratory data analysis
We perform data visualization
Preparing data for modelling
Building and training a simple deep-learning model
Evaluating the trained model
